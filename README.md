# Factions Pack

## Installation Steps

Install Java 17. I would recommend the [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) distribution.

Install a supported laucher, such as MultiMC or Prism Launcher.

Grab the [modpack zip](./releases/latest/download/Factions.zip).

Add an instance in your laucnher and import the zip file you just downloaded.
