# Factions Pack

## Installation Steps

Install Java 17. I would recommend the [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) distribution.

Install a supported laucher, such as MultiMC or Prism Launcher.

Grab the [modpack zip](https://github.com/ryleu/factions-pack/releases/download/auto-update/Factions.zip).

Add an instance in your launcher and import the zip file you just downloaded.

## Notes

This modpack uses packwiz, which means that as things change, the pack will update automatically. To make changes to the mod list, please fork my repository, enable the actions workflow, make your changes, using [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz), enable pages on the `gh-pages` branch, and then change the URL in the custom launch command to `https://username.github.io/main/pack.toml`, replacing username with your username.
